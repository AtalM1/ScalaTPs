TP3 additionnal stuff
=====================

Subject was:

 - Write a function taking a string as parameter and returning a mutable
 map containing the index of all the chars. ex:

    "nantes" => 'n' -> {0, 2}
                'a' -> {1}
                't' -> {3}
                'e' -> {4}
                's' -> {5}
 - Same thing but with an immutable map
 - Write a function that withdraws all zeros from a linked list
 (LinkedList)
